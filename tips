What Makes Stock Prices Go Up and Down?

There are many factors that determine whether stock prices rise or fall. These include the media, the opinions of well-known investors, natural disasters, political and social unrest, risk, supply and demand, and the lack of or abundance of suitable alternatives

> If there are more sellers than buyers, stock prices will tend to fall. Conversely, when there are more buyers than sellers, stock prices tend to rise.


Stock Valuation

The actual price of a stock is determined by market activity. 

When making the decision to buy or sell, the investor will often compare a stock’s actual price to its fair value. 

* For example, if a stock is trading at $30 per share and its fair value is $35, it may be worth purchasing. Conversely, if it trades at $30 but its fair value is $25, the stock would be considered overvalued and the investor would be wise to avoid it. What is a stock’s fair value and how do you calculate it? Ideally, it would be based on some standardized formula. However, there are many ways to derive this figure.


When is the Best Time to Buy and Sell?

##The two most important decisions an investor will make are when to buy and when to sell. 

- The best time to buy is when others are pessimistic. 
- The best time to sell is when others are actively optimistic. 

* When buying, remember that the prospect of a high return is greater if you buy after its price has fallen rather than after it has risen. 

> But caution should be exercised. For example, after the stock of fictitious Company X declined by 30%, 40% or more, the first question to ask is why. Why did the stock fall as it did? Did other stocks in the same industry experience a decline? If so, was it as severe? Did the entire stock market fall? If the broader market or other stocks in the same industry/sector performed relatively well, there may be a problem specific to Company X. 

##It’s best to adopt a buy/sell discipline and adhere to it.

## Don’t put all your eggs in one basket 
> When choosing your investments, it’s important to get the right mix so that you’re not over-reliant on the performance of any one investment type, sector, country etc
